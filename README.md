# Web Development Study Resources
In my experience, learning how to program itself isn't nearly as hard as deciding what to study, and where, and when.

With that in mind, here's a list of the webdev resources I've found most useful so far.

The topics are ordered based on [several bootcamp curricula](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sF3QfsbIqvHU9voigpPKD4BavspHQ_K0GeR0Hl3JE_0/edit#gid=1911839646) I've gathered, as well as my own experience tackling things in what I feel was the wrong order. 

There are some paid resources in this list, but I've only included the ones I've found valuable, and I've tried to mark them clearly. I don't receive any referral benefits from these resources.

## Coding for Kids
I was 35 years old when I began my career change to coding and started gathering these resources. I'm so amazed and impressed to see people who start learning to code when they're still in elementary school!

## Important Workflow Items
Both Command Line Interface and Git/GitHub are often presented toward the end of online classes, but I learned them beforehand and I'm glad I did.

Basic knowledge of The CLI and Git can do a lot to improve day-to-day quality of life, and they both also have a lot of small tricks to pick up over months and months. For both these reasons, they're good topics to tackle as early as possible.

Checking in code and deploying real webpages also allows development outside of CodePen, Cloud9, and other online editors. Making sure that all the scripts are integrated properly etc is a lot more difficult at first, but extremely educational.

### The Command Line
Typing text commands into the console seems extremely arcane at first, but becomes familiar surprisingly quickly.

It's useful for Git, Node development, and lots of other things, and honestly it also just feels cool and fun and hacker-y.

## Front-End Development
Most simply, "front-end" refers to the content that is actually presented on a webpage. The text, the images, the colors.

For example: A portfolio website that contains a bio, links to projects, and photos.

### HTML and CSS
HTML builds the structure of a webpage, and CSS dictates its layout and appearance.

I originally tried learning HTML a long time ago, and was pleasantly surprised to see that all the layout is now handled by CSS rules rather than horrible nested tables and frames.

### Bootstrap
Boostrap is mainly a ton of pre-built CSS classes which can be applied directly to HTML instead of writing custom CSS.

I originally tried to learn Bootstrap before understanding CSS well, which ended up being very confusing and frustrating. Over time I've come to appreciate its usefulness for making quick prototypes etc.

JavaScript is the only programming language that can reach into a webpage and modify the content of the HTML or the styling of the CSS.

### Functional JavaScript
Using functional programming is one of those weird things in programming that's actually more easily done than described.

Most of what FP means (at least early on) is using functions to iterate through arrays, rather than writing loops all over the place. It's more readable, and less error-prone.

### Manipulate the DOM with "Vanilla" JavaScript
The DOM is another concept that sounds scarier than it is.

The Document-Object Model is just the content of a webpage, parsed into an object so that JS can read and manipulate it.

Regular Expressions (Regex) are a way to easily parse some text and find all the places that match a given pattern.

For example, matching all the email addresses in a string, or all the 5-letter names starting with "Ja".

## Back-End Development
"Back-end" largely refers to gathering and assembling information on the server side, before sending it to the browser to be displayed.

The archetypical back-end pages are those that users can log into, and which store a lot of information about its users and their activities. For example: Facebook, Reddit, and Yelp.

### Deploying Back-End Web Apps
Webpages which require a server are basically too complicated to be deployed the same way as a simpler front-end page.

Heroku and similar services can host server-side projects (also called "apps") and serve them to users.

### Node.js and Express.js
JavaScript was originally only usable inside the client of a web browser. Node sets it free for use as a server-side language.

Express is a JS framework that makes it possible to write a server-side Node app more simply and tersely.

### MongoDB
MongoDB and other databases are the main way that sites store data permanently, so the data won't be reverted every time the program restarts.

For example: Facebook friends lists, Netflix queues, and Reddit comments.
